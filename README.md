# Notes taking APP [Memos](https://www.usememos.com/)

## Docker compose deployment

Here's an example to deploy Memos a simple note taking app backed up by a mysql database.
This is an example with Docker compose that you already know, your goal will be to deploy this app again, but this time in kubernetes.
You will have to deploy the database yourself and the app.
You should deliver the necessary yaml to deploy it onto kubernetes.

Good luck!
